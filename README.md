# Medict : AI Disease Detector

**Medict** is a robust multiple disease prediction system developed using ensemble machine learning algorithms. It is designed to predict several rare and common diseases, providing significant improvements in prediction accuracy. This system has the ability to predict the below following diseases:

- Lung Cancer
- Heart Disease
- Chronic Kidney Disease
- Brain Stroke
- Liver Disease
- Parkinson's Disease

The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in predictions, with an average improvement of 3-5% for each disease.
